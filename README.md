# Java IV REST Controllers Lab

Completing this lab demonstrates your ability to code Spring REST
controllers in a standards based way.

## Objective

Write a fully functional REST controller for the customers API

## Getting Started:

1. Copy the starter code from here into a new, private repository in your personal GitHub account using [these instructions](https://github.com/jeff-anderson-cscc/submitting-assignments-lab#copy-the-starter-code-into-a-new-private-repository-in-your-personal-github-account) substituting this repository URL ``https://github.com/jeff-anderson-cscc/java4-labs-rest-controllers`` for the one referenced in that document
2. Create a new branch for your code changes as described in [these instructions](https://github.com/jeff-anderson-cscc/submitting-assignments-lab#before-you-start-coding)

## Completing the Assignment

__Important__ You may not change the code in any test cases. _The only permissible difference between the base version of the JUnit test class and yours is yours will have no tests commented out and the file is otherwise identical._

1. Open [CustomerControllerValidationTests](src/test/java/edu/cscc/java4/rest/CustomerControllerValidationTests.java)
1. One by one, uncomment each test, changing just enough code or configuration to make the test pass
1. Once all tests are passing, commit your changes

### OPTIONAL 

This won't be graded but will demonstrate your understanding of Java Bean validation in REST 
controllers

1. Open [CustomerControllerTests](src/test/java/edu/cscc/java4/rest/CustomerControllerTests.java)
1. One by one, uncomment each test, changing just enough code or configuration to make the test pass
1. Once all tests are passing, commit your changes

1. Push your changes to GitHub
1. Create a pull request for your branch using [these instructions](https://github.com/jeff-anderson-cscc/submitting-assignments-lab#once-you-are-ready-to-submit-your-work-for-grading)
1. Submit the assignment in Blackboard as described in [these instructions](https://github.com/jeff-anderson-cscc/submitting-assignments-lab#once-your-pull-request-is-created-and-i-am-added-as-a-reviewer)
